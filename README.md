# OpenStory

**OpenStory** is a decoupled admin interface, capable of improving the usability of any `Drupal` website. With a `NodeJS middleware`, the **OpenStory** interface allows content managers to edit content in a collaborative way, 
 to manage multiple sites and to share the media gallery across various sites (feature enabled for multisite platforms).

See [Demo](https://demo.openstory.io) or visit the [Presentation site](https://openstory.io/).


## About OpenStory

A reusable tool, **OpenStory** translates `Drupal` terms and features in a human-friendly language, 
specially designed to fit all types of editorial needs.

Using `Angular` and `NodeJS`, the interface provides a clean and bright design that will ease the editorial flow. **OpenStory** connects to your site via a module which exposes securely, 
services to help editors interact with the interface.
    

## Getting Started

**OpenStory** allows you and your editors to manage:
 * comments 
 * users 
 * already existing content types. 
 
Also, the interface provides a series of `statistics` and `widgets` that facilitate a better media management in a smart and adaptive environment.

Just imagine having only the information you need a click-away, without the need to access third-party applications or services.

## Build and Development server

To get started you need the latest [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version. 
* Run `npm install` to download all the dependencies for the application.
* Into the environment file (E.g. `enironment.ts`) it needs to add the server url in the `ws_url` property. The url needs to be absolute (E.g. http://example.com).
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
* Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

If ran locally the `documentation` folder contains all the necessary information regarding the project since this is powerd by `COMPODOC`. 
Just open the `index.html` file and you will be able to navigate through out the project.
